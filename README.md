Sometimes the app is buggy, restart the app first if you encounter any issues like abnormally long latency times, that usually fixes the problem

Make sure your input and output devices are correct by clicking on the microphone icon or the speaker icon and selecting your device

## Note

The FreeVC directory is just the [FreeVC repository](https://github.com/OlaWod/FreeVC) but I removed any unnecessary files
